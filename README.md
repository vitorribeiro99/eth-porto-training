# ETH Porto Bounty

The goal of this bounty is to build a web3 project that uses LayerX dappKit and rocketKit frameworks.

Themes: 

- NFT 
- DeFi 
- Infrastructure 
- Integrations 
- Education 
- Supply Chain 
- DeSci
- Coomon Goods

To Deliver your solution open a pull request on [Bepro App](https://app.bepro.network). 

*Note: You will need a metamask wallet to open a pull request and connect to Moonbeam Chain. BTW , if you need GLMR to transact on Moonbeam you can use a [Faucet](https://glmr.supply/)*

If you need any help please contact our team hello@taikai.network

Happy Hacking üéØ

## Boiler Plate Project
This boilerplate project with  Nextjs + dappKit + Rocket Kit could be used as a starting point

-  [Contracts](./contracts/README.md) - An Hardhat Project for your smart contracts
-  [Interface](./frontend/README.md) - A Next.js project with a dappKit Context built-in 

## Rocket Kit 
Rocket Kit is an React.js open source UI Design System used by LayerX products.

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@taikai/rocket-kit)

## dappKit 

dappKit is a powerful Typescript/Javascript SDK that allows you to develop beautiful web3 apps in a matter of minutes. We mean it.

### Connect to an EVM Blockchain node in 3 lines of code
Connecting is as easy as providing a RPC Url and (optionally) a private key to the WebConnection and calling a connect method.

### Interact with EVM Smart Contract methods and public data
The Model class provides two important methods, sendTx and callTx with which its possible to interact with any deployed contract on the blockchain; The same class also provides all methods, and typings, under the contract.methods property getter.

### Deploy standard and custom contracts
ERC-20, ERC-1155, ERC-721, or other custom contracts can be deployed to any EVM compatible blockchain. By providing the Model with a Web3Connection and an ABI array, the deploy() function becomes available, providing the required arguments will return a TransactionReceipt holding the new contractAddress. You can even use dappKit to create custom typescript or javascript scripts to interact with any EVM blockchain

### Wallet Integration
Integrates easily with Metamask to sign and submit smart contract transactions in your javascript dapp.

### Generate a wrapper for your EVM contract
Interact with your smart contract on your dapp by generating a typescript/javascript wrapper using [dappKit LaunchPad](https://github.com/taikai/dappkit-launchpad)
